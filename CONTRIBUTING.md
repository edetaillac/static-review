# Contributing

The following guidelines for contribution should be followed if you wish to submit a pull request.

## Getting Started

* If you have found a bug, submit an [ticket][issues] for your issue if one **does not** exist already

    * Describe the issue and include steps to reproduce the problem

* If you are able and want to fix this, fork the repository on GitHub

* When adding a feature, feel free to [get in contact][twitter] before starting any development

## Making Changes

* In your forked repository, create a topic branch for your upcoming patch (e.g. `feature/svn-support` or `bugfix/example-review-fix`)

    * Create a branch based on `master`, but please **do not** work directly on the `master` branch

* Make sure you stick to the coding style that is used already

* If possible, submit unit tests with your patch / new feature

* Ensure that nothing is broken by [running the test suite][test-suite]
